# ridge
Ridge regression for multivariate temporal receptive fields.

Originally written by Alexander Huth ([original repo](https://github.com/alexhuth/ridge)), with edits by Liberty Hamilton for use with ECoG and EEG data, where the number of time points is typically larger than the number of electrodes/channels.
